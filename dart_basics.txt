Data type (Const type) ====>
int , double , bool , String , list , set , map , Enum , Function , symbol , Null , runes ==> 
int : integers number
double : is a floating point numeric type that represents decimal number with double precision (64-bit) .
bool: true or fauls .  
String : representing a sequence of characters. 
list (as a data type) : used tostore an ordered collection of values of the same type .
set (as a data type) : represent an unordered collection of unipue values .
map (as a data type) : associates keys with value . 
Enum : fixed constant value . 
Function: functions as object .
symbol : symbol identifiers 
Null : null value
runes : Any numerical values ​​that represent letters and symbols (including emojis and special characters).


Super type ====>
Object,Iterable,num ==>
object: root data type , can hold any value while still enforcing type through runtime checks and casting . 
Iterable<T> : parent of (List , Set) . 
num : parent of (int , double) . 


Type inference & Dynamic Typing Keywords ====>
var , dynamic ==>
var : Dart automatically detects the type at the first value (type inference)
dynamic : A special type that allows changing the typw at any time , Dart does not check the type during translation.

Unicode & Text-Related type ====>
String : UTF-16 text . 
Runes : Unicode code points .



special purpose Type ====>
Never , Type ==>
Never : indecates a value that never occurs .
Type : represents a type at runtime . 


** const :  When you know the value beforehand and want it to always be constant. (compile-time constant).
** final : When you want a value that will not change after being set, but may depend on the runtime . (runtime constant).


(Data structures / clooection types)
set , list , map ==> 
list  :   []  - changeable  - ordered  - allow duplicate 
set :  {}  - unchangeable  - unordered  - no duplicate
map  : {}  - unchangeable  - unordered   - no duplicate 
• Ordered →
  Elements in a collection (like List) have a specific order.
  Each element has an index (0, 1, 2, ...).
  Accessing index 0 returns the first element.

• Unordered →
  Elements have no fixed order.
  Set does not care about position, only about unique values.
  There is no index in Set.

• Changeable (Mutable) →
  You can add, remove, or modify elements after creating the collection.

• Unchangeable (Immutable) →
  You cannot add, remove, or modify elements after creating the collection.
